for showing special module. try this:
	with pip: pip freeze | grep <module-name>
	with conda: conda list | grep <package-name>	
	
	
you can use 'alias' for setting a custom command:

	open your bash shell from your home directory in your text editor. 
	(maybe you used .bashrc or .zshrc, etc)
	$ code ~/.bashrc (my editor is vscode). you can use $ open ~/.bashrc.
	
	in the bottom of your bash commands add some alias that you want. like bellow:
	alias who-are-you="echo My name is Alireza Khajehvandi...!, who are You...!?"
	
	Finally, close your terminal and open it again in other words reset your terminal and test your new command :)
